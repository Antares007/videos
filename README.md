M-word.       Any instruction from the CPU instruction set.
M-text space. Continuous space in the random access memory (RAM) of a computer.
M-text.       A bunch of M-words in the M-text space.
              Let's visualize it as a vertical line of a cross.
OarS.         M-text space is used as two stack-like structures facing each other.
              From "ο" to "α" let's call it the N-text space,
          and from "σ" down to "ρ" let's call it S-pith.
              Let's visualize it as a horizontal line of a cross.
N-text.       A bunch of N-words is composed according to syntax rules.
N-word.       Void C function with four fixed parameters "ο," "α," "ρ," and "σ."
              Next, the M-text defines the N-word, and finally,
              the N-word must answer the question to act as a whole word.
              That means that the last M-word must be a jump (goto) into S-pith.
              In other words, the N-word must decide which junction ray/adapter
              to use to continue the execution of the sentence.
